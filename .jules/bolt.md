## 2025-05-19 - [Optimized re-renders with React.memo and useCallback]
**Learning:** In applications where state is managed at the top level and updated on every keystroke, the entire component tree re-renders by default. This is especially impactful when there are multiple complex forms and a live preview. Stable function references via `useCallback` and memoization via `React.memo` are critical for maintaining a responsive UI.
**Action:** Always check for top-level state updates and ensure child components are memoized if they only depend on specific slices of that state. Extract static maps outside of components to avoid unnecessary re-initialization.
